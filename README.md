# science-project
Testing performance in model rockets - an elementary science fair project. Simple HTML &amp; CSS using FontAwesome, jQuery, and Bootstrap

A single page template for displaying results in a science experiment using tabs. 
I completed this to use as a visual aid for my son's 5th grade project.
